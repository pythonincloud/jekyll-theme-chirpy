### Overview

In this tutorial you will learn basics of programming in Python in 9 simple steps:
1. Install and setup Software
2. Learn how to print data in Python program
3. Learn how to enter data in Python program
4. Learn Variables
5. Learn a bit about Strings
6. Learn how to do Math in Python program
7. Learn Conditional Statements (if/elif/else)
8. Learn Functions
9. Learn The While Loop

You are going to learn it by doing. Together, we're going to create a simple calculator and add more and more functionality to it with each step above. 

You might be wondering what are all those things in the steps above and why do we need them? The answer is that they are the most fundamental blocks of knowledge in any programming language.

It might be hard to see how they make sense at this moment and even while you learn them individually. However a big picture will arise once you put enough efforts into the practice. 

Here are some tips on how to go through the tutorial:
- Code along in the Theory sections.
- Try to resolve the Practice exercises by yourself. 
- If you can't make it, don't worry. I provided solutions everywhere.
