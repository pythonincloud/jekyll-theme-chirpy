## Overview

In this tutorial you will learn basics of programming in Python.

The **key benefits** of this tutorial:
- Learn it step-by-step
- Every step has a theory section where I provide:
  - Where possible - an analogy which helps to relate a complex subject with a familiar situation
  - An example or two of implementing the subject in a source code
  - Each example is visualized
- Every step has a practice section where you're going to apply the theoretical knowledge you've just learned

I broke it down into 9 simple steps:
1. Install and setup Software
2. Learn how to print data in Python program
3. Learn how to enter data in Python program
4. Learn Variables
5. Learn how to merge Strings
6. Learn how to do Math in Python program
7. Learn Conditional Statements (if/elif/else)
8. Learn Functions
9. Learn The While Loop

Together, we're going to create a simple calculator and add more and more functionality to it with each step above. 

You might be wondering what are all those things in the steps above and why do we need them? The answer is that they are the most fundamental blocks of knowledge in any programming language.

It might be hard to see how they make sense at this moment and even while you learn them individually. However a big picture will arise once you put enough efforts into the practice. 

> Here are some tips on how to go through the tutorial:
- **Always** code along in the Theory sections.
- Try to resolve the Practice exercises by yourself. 
- If you can't make it, don't worry. I provided solutions everywhere.
